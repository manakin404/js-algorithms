# Sieve of Eratosthenes

The Sieve of Eratosthenes is an ancient greek algorithm for finding all prime numbers up to a given limit $n$

With a given number $n$, the algorithm returns all prime numbers less than or equal to $n$. This is achieved by marking multiples of each prime starting from 2 and eliminating composites.

The time and space complexity for this algorithm are $O(N\ \log(\log\ N))$ and $O(n)$ respectively.
